- [x] 4.4 Verify Flux controllers are running in flux-system namespace
- [x] 4.5 Create Kustomization resource for infrastructure sync (in infrastructure repo)
- [x] 4.6 Create GitRepository resource pointing to apps repo (in infrastructure repo)
- [x] 4.7 Create Kustomization resource for apps sync with dependency on infrastructure
- [x] 4.8 Commit and push changes to infrastructure repo
- [x] 4.9 Verify auto-sync is working (1-minute interval) for both repos

## 5. Flux Bootstrap - Staging Environment
- [ ] 5.1 Switch kubectl context to staging cluster
- [ ] 5.2 Run `flux bootstrap github` for infrastructure repo on staging environment

- [ ] 5.5 Create GitRepository resource for apps repo with tag-based ref
- [ ] 5.6 Create Kustomization resources for infrastructure and apps
- [ ] 5.7 Document tag-based promotion workflow
- [ ] 5.8 Test manual promotion with sample tag (e.g., staging-v0.1.0)

## 6. Flux Bootstrap - Production Environment
- [ ] 6.1 Switch kubectl context to production cluster
- [ ] 6.2 Run `flux bootstrap github` for infrastructure repo on production environment
- [ ] 6.3 Verify Flux controllers are running
- [ ] 6.4 Configure infrastructure GitRepository with tag-based ref
- [ ] 6.5 Create GitRepository resource for apps repo with tag-based ref
- [ ] 6.6 Create Kustomization resources for infrastructure and apps
- [ ] 6.7 Test manual promotion with sample tag (e.g., prod-v0.1.0)
- [ ] 6.8 Document production deployment procedures

## 7. Notification Setup
- [ ] 7.1 Create notification Provider resources (e.g., Slack, generic webhook)
- [ ] 7.2 Create Alert resources for deployment events
- [ ] 7.3 Configure alerts for Flux controller health
- [ ] 7.4 Test notification delivery for dev environment
- [ ] 7.5 Apply notification configuration to staging and production

## 8. Health Checks and Monitoring
- [x] 8.1 Add health check Kustomization for Flux controllers
- [ ] 8.2 Create ServiceMonitor resources for Prometheus (if available)
- [x] 8.3 Document Flux status check commands
- [x] 8.4 Create troubleshooting guide for common Flux issues
- [x] 8.5 Add validation script to verify Flux sync status

## 9. RBAC and Security
- [ ] 9.1 Review Flux RBAC permissions (cluster-admin vs. limited)
- [ ] 9.2 Create namespace-specific RBAC if needed
- [ ] 9.3 Configure network policies for Flux controllers
