# Flux Bootstrap Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: GitHub Repository Integration

The system SHALL bootstrap FluxCD on Kubernetes clusters with GitHub repository integration using Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication.

#### Scenario: Bootstrap dev environment with auto-sync

- **GIVEN** a Kubernetes cluster for dev environment
- **AND** GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is set with valid PAT
- **AND** kubectl context points to dev cluster
- **WHEN** `flux bootstrap github` is executed with owner=misua, repository=fluxcd, path=clusters/dev
- **THEN** Flux controllers are installed in flux-system namespace
- **AND** GitRepository resource is created pointing to https://github.com/misua/fluxcd
- **AND** Kustomization resources are created for infrastructure and apps
- **AND** auto-sync is enabled with 1-minute interval

#### Scenario: Bootstrap staging environment with tag-based sync

- **GIVEN** a Kubernetes cluster for staging environment
- **AND** GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is set with valid PAT
- **AND** kubectl context points to staging cluster
- **WHEN** `flux bootstrap github` is executed with owner=misua, repository=fluxcd, path=clusters/staging
- **THEN** Flux controllers are installed in flux-system namespace
- **AND** GitRepository resource is created with tag-based reference
- **AND** manual promotion workflow is enabled via Git tags

#### Scenario: Bootstrap production environment with tag-based sync

- **GIVEN** a Kubernetes cluster for production environment
- **AND** GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is set with valid PAT
- **AND** kubectl context points to production cluster
- **WHEN** `flux bootstrap github` is executed with owner=misua, repository=fluxcd, path=clusters/production
- **THEN** Flux controllers are installed in flux-system namespace
- **AND** GitRepository resource is created with tag-based reference
- **AND** manual promotion workflow is enabled via Git tags
- **AND** production-specific safety controls are applied

### Requirement: Flux Controller Health Monitoring

The system SHALL provide health checks and status monitoring for all Flux controllers.

#### Scenario: Verify Flux controller health

- **GIVEN** Flux is bootstrapped on a cluster
- **WHEN** `flux check` command is executed
- **THEN** all Flux controllers report healthy status
- **AND** GitRepository sync status is displayed
- **AND** Kustomization reconciliation status is shown

#### Scenario: Detect Flux controller failure

- **GIVEN** Flux is bootstrapped on a cluster
- **AND** a Flux controller pod crashes
- **WHEN** health check is performed
- **THEN** failed controller is identified
- **AND** error details are provided
- **AND** remediation steps are suggested

### Requirement: GitHub PAT Authentication

The system SHALL use GitHub Personal Access Token for repository authentication with proper permissions.

#### Scenario: Authenticate with valid PAT

- **GIVEN** GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable contains valid PAT
- **AND** PAT has repo scope permissions
- **WHEN** Flux bootstrap is executed
- **THEN** GitHub authentication succeeds
- **AND** Flux can read repository contents
- **AND** Flux can write commit status updates

#### Scenario: Handle expired PAT

- **GIVEN** GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable contains expired PAT
- **WHEN** Flux attempts to sync from repository
- **THEN** authentication error is reported
- **AND** sync status shows authentication failure
- **AND** alert is triggered for PAT rotation

### Requirement: Multi-Cluster Bootstrap Support

The system SHALL support independent Flux installations across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

#### Scenario: Bootstrap multiple environments independently

- **GIVEN** three Kubernetes clusters (dev, staging, production)
- **WHEN** Flux bootstrap is executed for each cluster with environment-specific paths
- **THEN** each cluster has independent Flux installation
- **AND** each cluster syncs from its designated path
- **AND** cluster failures are isolated (no cross-cluster impact)

### Requirement: Flux Uninstall and Rollback

The system SHALL provide safe uninstall and rollback procedures for Flux installations.

#### Scenario: Uninstall Flux from cluster

- **GIVEN** Flux is installed on a cluster
- **WHEN** `flux uninstall` command is executed
- **THEN** all Flux controllers are removed
- **AND** flux-system namespace is deleted
- **AND** CRDs are optionally preserved or removed based on flag
- **AND** managed Kubernetes resources remain unchanged unless pruned

#### Scenario: Rollback to previous Flux version

- **GIVEN** Flux is upgraded to a new version
- **AND** new version causes issues
- **WHEN** Git repository is reverted to previous Flux manifests
- **THEN** Flux self-heals to previous version
- **AND** cluster state matches previous configuration
