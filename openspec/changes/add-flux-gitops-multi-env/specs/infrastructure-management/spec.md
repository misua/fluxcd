- **AND** apps continue running during infrastructure update

#### Scenario: Promote infrastructure change to production

- **GIVEN** infrastructure change is validated in staging

- **AND** production-specific overlays are applied
- **AND** zero-downtime deployment is ensured
- **AND** rollback plan is documented

### Requirement: Infrastructure RBAC and Security

The system SHALL apply appropriate RBAC and security policies for infrastructure resources.

#### Scenario: Cluster-admin permissions for infrastructure

- **GIVEN** infrastructure Kustomization is configured
- **WHEN** Flux reconciles infrastructure resources
- **THEN** Flux service account has cluster-admin permissions (or limited permissions as configured)
- **AND** infrastructure resources can modify cluster-wide settings
- **AND** RBAC policies are audited

#### Scenario: Namespace-specific RBAC for apps

- **GIVEN** apps Kustomization is configured
- **WHEN** Flux reconciles app resources
- **THEN** Flux service account has namespace-scoped permissions
- **AND** apps cannot modify cluster-wide infrastructure
- **AND** RBAC boundaries are enforced

### Requirement: Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerts

The system SHALL monitor infrastructure health and send alerts for failures.

#### Scenario: Monitor infrastructure reconciliation

- **GIVEN** infrastructure Kustomization is deployed
- **WHEN** Flux reconciles infrastructure
- **THEN** reconciliation status is tracked
- **AND** reconciliation metrics are exposed
- **AND** failed reconciliations trigger alerts
- **AND** drift detection is enabled

#### Scenario: Alert on infrastructure failure

- **GIVEN** infrastructure Kustomization is configured with alerts
- **AND** notification provider is set up
- **WHEN** infrastructure reconciliation fails
- **THEN** alert is sent to configured channel
- **AND** error details are included
- **AND** remediation steps are suggested

### Requirement: Infrastructure Version Tracking

The system SHALL track infrastructure versions and changes via Git history.

#### Scenario: Audit infrastructure changes
